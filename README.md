- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on populating my websites with some content to gain traction. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about Data Structures, making websites, java script and python.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with making website, making OOP Games in python run fast.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about programming in python, about any programming actually because there is no different logic, only languages. 
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Message me on instagram, start a issue in the [letsgetcodingnow.github.io](www.github.com/letsgetcodingnow/letsgetcodingnow) repo, or just plain email me @ (tusdeve@gmail.com)
